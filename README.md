Dbms Lab Project
================

This program is a database seeding tool, which seeds a mongo database with fake values to get started.

**Prerequisites:**
- Requires NodeJS in order to run the program.
- Requires mongodb to be installed on your system.

## Installation
To install nodejs, visit the [nodejs download page](http://nodejs.org/download/). Select your platform, download the binary and install it.

Node comes with a handy package manager called `npm` which is used to install node packages.

## Quickstart
If you already have nodejs installed, clone the directory or download the zipfile form github. Go into the directory and run the `npm install && npm start` command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whoisandie/dbmslab.git
cd dbmslab
npm install && npm start
```

Thats it, a database called dbmslab is created in mongo.
